##BREAKOUT

###How to play
When you enter the game, you can use mouse to select some options.
As you start the game, you can use → and ← to control the paddle.
When the ball touch the brike, the brike will disappear, and ball will rebound. The ball also rebound when it touch the border(except down-border) and the paddle.
Your purpose is to wipe all the brikes.
